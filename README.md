# HushGP
A PushGP implementation in Haskell

## Tasks
* [ ] Do test-driven development on this one.
    * [ ] Write tests for every function.
    * [ ] tests/ are just copied from make-grade, need to write for this project.

I would really like to benchmark the following three versions for speed: 
1) My custom data one (this repo)
2) direct independent lists for each stack (Rowan's miniHush)
3) eval string (similar to my custumized version of propel clojure)
